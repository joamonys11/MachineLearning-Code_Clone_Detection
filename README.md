# 🔍 Code Clone Detection Using Machine Learning & Deep Learning

This project focuses on **detecting code clones** using **machine learning and deep learning techniques**. Code clone detection helps improve software quality by identifying duplicated or highly similar code fragments that may increase maintenance cost and bug propagation.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
Code cloning is a common practice in software development, but excessive duplication can negatively affect maintainability and scalability. This project applies **data processing, feature extraction, and predictive models** to detect code clones efficiently.

The implementation is provided as a **Jupyter Notebook**, covering the full pipeline from data preprocessing to model evaluation.
